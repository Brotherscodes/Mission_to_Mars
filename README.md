# Mission_to_Mars



## Project Overview: 

<b>

In this project, `Splinter` will be used to automate a web browser, `BeautifulSoup` to parse and extract the data, and `MongoDB` to hold the data that has been gathered in a `NoSQL` database. Using this technique, we have the ability to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, then present it in a central location: a webpage.
